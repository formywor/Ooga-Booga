      <h2>1. Plain-language overview</h2>
      <p>
        ScriptNova Unblocker (“ScriptNova,” “we,” “us”) is a platform with features that may include account login,
        service access tools, and optional in-app messaging. This page explains:
        what you can do on ScriptNova, what you’re not allowed to do, what information we collect,
        how we use it, and when we may share certain ScriptNova-related records.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Important limits:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not want your Google/Microsoft/school account password. Only your ScriptNova password is used for ScriptNova login.</li>
          <li>We don’t claim a right to take “everything about you.” We collect and share what is reasonably needed to operate safely and enforce these rules.</li>
          <li>If you send messages through ScriptNova, those messages can be reviewed for moderation and safety, as explained below.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="muted">
        If you don’t agree with these terms, don’t use ScriptNova.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="terms">
      <h2>2. Terms of Service</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        By creating an account, logging in, or using ScriptNova, you agree to follow these Terms and the Privacy Policy.
        If you break these terms, we may limit, suspend, or terminate your access.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Eligibility and authorization</h3>
      <p>
        You may use ScriptNova only if you are allowed to use it under the rules that apply to you,
        including school rules, district/county rules, classroom rules, device rules, and network rules.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Your ScriptNova account</h3>
      <p>
        ScriptNova accounts use a password you choose for ScriptNova. That password is used to sign into ScriptNova.
        We store ScriptNova passwords using one-way hashing (a standard security method), not as readable text.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for anything done through your ScriptNova account. Don’t share your login.
        If you think someone else accessed your account, stop using it and reset your password if that option is available.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Service changes</h3>
      <p>
        We may update, modify, pause, or discontinue any part of ScriptNova at any time for maintenance, security,
        performance, or abuse prevention.
      </p>

      <h3>2.5 No guarantees</h3>
      <p>
        ScriptNova is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee uninterrupted access or that every network or device will support ScriptNova.
      </p>

      <h3>2.6 Enforcement actions</h3>
      <p>
        If we believe an account is involved in abuse, harassment, threats, cheating, attempts to bypass rules, or other prohibited behavior,
        we may take actions like warnings, rate limits, temporary locks, suspensions, or permanent bans.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="acceptable">
      <h2>3. Acceptable use and prohibited behavior</h2>
      <p>You agree you will not use ScriptNova to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>break school, district/county, classroom, device, or network rules;</li>
        <li>harass, threaten, or target others;</li>
        <li>share or request private information that doesn’t belong to you;</li>
        <li>spread malware, run exploits, or attack networks, devices, accounts, or services;</li>
        <li>impersonate other people or pretend to be staff/administrators;</li>
        <li>evade enforcement actions (like bans) or create accounts to continue prohibited behavior;</li>
        <li>use automation to overload or scrape ScriptNova.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="bad">
        If ScriptNova is used in a way that violates these rules, we may restrict access and we may preserve relevant records for enforcement and safety.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="privacy">
      <h2>4. Privacy policy</h2>
      <p>
        This section explains what information we collect and why. The main idea is simple:
        we collect the minimum needed to run ScriptNova, keep it secure, and enforce rules fairly.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        If you use ScriptNova on a school-managed device or network, your school may be able to monitor traffic through its own tools.
        That monitoring is controlled by the school, not by ScriptNova.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="data">
      <h2>5. Data we collect (detailed)</h2>

      <h3>5.1 Account and profile information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ScriptNova username</strong> (the name you choose on the platform).</li>
        <li><strong>ScriptNova password</strong> (stored as a one-way hash for authentication, not readable text).</li>
        <li><strong>Basic account settings</strong> (preferences you choose inside ScriptNova, if any).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.2 Usage logs (when and how the service is used)</h3>
      <p>
        When you use ScriptNova, we may create logs that include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account activity timestamps</strong> (account created time, first login time, last login time).</li>
        <li><strong>Session records</strong> (start time, end time, approximate duration).</li>
        <li><strong>Feature usage</strong> (which parts of ScriptNova were used, like login, settings, or messaging).</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency records</strong> (how often the service was used, such as daily/weekly counts).</li>
        <li><strong>Service events</strong> (errors, crashes, or actions needed to keep the platform stable).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.3 Device and technical information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IP address</strong> (often needed for security, abuse prevention, and fraud detection).</li>
        <li><strong>Device details</strong> (browser type, operating system, and basic device identifiers like user-agent).</li>
        <li><strong>Performance data</strong> (latency, loading times, error codes).</li>
        <li><strong>Security signals</strong> (failed login attempts, suspicious behavior, automated/bot-like traffic).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.4 Content you submit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>In-app messages</strong> you send through ScriptNova (if ScriptNova includes messaging).</li>
        <li><strong>Reports</strong> you submit (like reporting abuse or issues).</li>
        <li><strong>Support requests</strong> you send through ScriptNova (if available).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.5 What we do not collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not collect passwords for your school email, Google account, Microsoft account, or other third-party accounts.</li>
        <li>We do not keylog or secretly record everything you type outside ScriptNova.</li>
        <li>We do not claim access to your personal files unless you upload them into ScriptNova.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="messages">
      <h2>6. Messages and moderation</h2>
      <p>
        If ScriptNova includes an in-app messaging feature, the messages you send through ScriptNova are part of the service.
        That means they can be stored, delivered, and reviewed for moderation and safety.
      </p>

      <h3>6.1 Why messages may be reviewed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To enforce these Terms (for example: harassment, threats, bullying, or cheating coordination).</li>
        <li>To protect users from abuse and keep the service safe.</li>
        <li>To investigate credible reports of rule-breaking or harmful behavior.</li>
        <li>To respond to legal requests where required.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.2 Limits on message review</h3>
      <p>
        We do not review messages just to “see what you’re doing.” Reviews are tied to moderation, safety, abuse prevention,
        or investigations. We focus on content that is relevant to rule enforcement.
      </p>

      <h3>6.3 Message content rules</h3>
      <p>
        You may not use ScriptNova messages to harass, threaten, dox, scam, share illegal content, or coordinate policy violations.
        Accounts involved in prohibited messaging may be restricted or terminated.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="use">
      <h2>7. How we use information</h2>
      <p>We use collected information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Operate ScriptNova</strong> (logins, sessions, delivering features).</li>
        <li><strong>Secure ScriptNova</strong> (detect abuse, prevent attacks, protect accounts).</li>
        <li><strong>Moderate content</strong> (including in-app messages, where applicable).</li>
        <li><strong>Enforce rules</strong> (investigate violations and apply restrictions).</li>
        <li><strong>Improve reliability</strong> (fix bugs, reduce downtime, understand performance issues).</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        We do not use your data to claim ownership of you, and we do not sell personal data to advertisers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="sharing">
      <h2>8. Sharing and disclosure</h2>

      <h3>8.1 No selling of personal information</h3>
      <p>
        We do not sell personal information to advertisers or data brokers.
      </p>

      <h3>8.2 Vendors that help run ScriptNova</h3>
      <p>
        We may use infrastructure and security providers to host and protect ScriptNova. Those providers may process limited data
        on our behalf to keep the service working and secure.
      </p>

      <h3>8.3 Legal and safety disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose information if required by a valid legal process, or if needed to address safety and security issues.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="school">
      <h2>9. School administrator disclosure (separate section)</h2>

      <p class="warn">
        This section matters if you use ScriptNova in a school setting. ScriptNova may share limited ScriptNova-related information
        with authorized school administrators when there is a credible reason tied to policy enforcement, safety, or security.
      </p>

      <h3>9.1 When we may share information with school administrators</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When there is a credible report or evidence of a violation of these Terms through ScriptNova.</li>
        <li>When there is a safety concern (threats, harassment, targeted abuse, or similar serious issues).</li>
        <li>When there is suspected cheating, impersonation, scams, or coordinated wrongdoing using ScriptNova features.</li>
        <li>When access appears automated or malicious (e.g., repeated attacks or abuse).</li>
        <li>When required by law or when a school is acting as the authorized administrator for a school-managed deployment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9.2 What information we may share (specific categories)</h3>
      <p>
        We share information that is connected to ScriptNova use and is relevant to the issue being investigated.
        Depending on the situation, that may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ScriptNova username</strong> and internal account identifier.</li>
        <li><strong>Account creation date/time</strong> and <strong>first-seen date/time</strong> on the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Login and usage timestamps</strong> (for example: each time the account logged in, and session start/end times).</li>
        <li><strong>Feature usage records</strong> (which ScriptNova features were used and when).</li>
        <li><strong>Relevant in-app message content</strong> that violates these Terms (for example: harassment, threats, bullying, cheating coordination, scams).</li>
        <li><strong>Moderation outcomes</strong> (warnings, suspensions, bans) and the reasons tied to these Terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical/security records</strong> needed to investigate abuse (such as IP address, user-agent, and repeated failed login attempts).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9.3 What we do not promise to share</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not claim to know your real-world identity if you never provided it on ScriptNova.</li>
        <li>We do not share third-party account passwords (school email, Google, Microsoft, etc.) because we do not collect them.</li>
        <li>We do not claim we can provide “everything about you.” Disclosures are limited to ScriptNova-related records relevant to enforcement, safety, or security.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9.4 Why we do this</h3>
      <p>
        The goal is to keep ScriptNova from being used to harm people, cheat, harass, scam, or break rules,
        and to support legitimate enforcement when ScriptNova itself is part of the problem.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        If you are using a school-managed device or school network, your school may already have visibility into network activity.
        ScriptNova does not control what your school can see through its own systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="retention">
      <h2>10. Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep information only as long as needed for the service to run safely, for abuse prevention, and for enforcement.
        Retention can vary depending on the type of record:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account records</strong> are kept while the account exists and may remain in backups for a limited time.</li>
        <li><strong>Security logs</strong> are kept long enough to detect patterns of abuse and investigate incidents.</li>
        <li><strong>Messages</strong> may be kept for moderation, safety, and enforcement, especially when tied to reports or violations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        We may preserve specific records longer if they are connected to an investigation, safety issue, or valid legal request.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="security">
      <h2>11. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable safeguards designed to protect ScriptNova accounts and data, including access controls and encrypted connections where supported.
        No system is perfect, and using any online service carries risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can help by using a strong password on ScriptNova, not reusing passwords from other sites, and logging out of shared devices.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="changes">
      <h2>12. Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms and this Privacy Policy. The newest version will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
        Continued use of ScriptNova after an update means you agree to the updated terms.
