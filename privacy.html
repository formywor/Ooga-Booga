    <h1>GameLinkr Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="sub">
      This Privacy Policy explains how GameLinkr (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use
      the GameLinkr app and related services (together, the “Service”).

      <h2>1) Quick Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We collect information you provide (like account email, website submissions, and support messages).</li>
        <li>We may collect photos or videos you choose to upload (like listing logos and thumbnails).</li>
        <li>We use data to run the app, keep it safe, improve search/recommendations, and help customer support.</li>
        <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
        <li>You can request deletion of certain data and control some choices in the app.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Important:</strong> The Service includes links to third-party websites (the gaming sites you open). Once you leave the app,
        those sites have their own privacy policies, and we do not control what they collect.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2) What This Policy Covers</h2>
      <p>
        This policy covers information collected through the GameLinkr app and any official pages or support channels we operate for the app.
        It does <strong>not</strong> cover third-party websites that you visit through links in the app, or third-party services not controlled by us.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3) Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>A) Contact Info</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Address</strong> — used for account setup, login, verification, and important account messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Other User Contact Info</strong> — if you choose to add contact details to your creator profile (example: social links or contact methods),
          we may store it so users can find and connect with creators.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B) User Content</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos or Videos</strong> — if you upload a listing logo/thumbnail or other media inside the app, we store it so the listing can be displayed.</li>
        <li><strong>Other User Content</strong> — website titles, descriptions, tags, profile bios, reports you submit, and other text you choose to post.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C) Customer Support</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Support Messages</strong> — what you send us (emails, tickets, or in-app support messages), including attachments you provide.</li>
        <li><strong>Issue Details</strong> — device/app version, timestamps, and basic troubleshooting details you share to help solve problems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>D) Usage and App Functionality Data</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        We may collect limited usage data needed to operate the Service and reduce abuse.
        This can include general activity like opening listings, favoriting, searching, and reporting.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Events</strong> — actions like opening a listing, favoriting/unfavoriting, sharing, or submitting a report.</li>
        <li><strong>Approximate Timing</strong> — timestamps so we can show Recent content, enforce limits, and fix bugs.</li>
        <li><strong>Device/App Signals</strong> — basic signals used to protect the Service (example: preventing spam or repeated actions).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>E) Payments (Promotion Purchases)</h3>
      <p>
        If you purchase a promoted “Sponsored” listing, the payment is processed by Apple.
        We may store purchase-related records inside the Service, such as a transaction identifier and promotion start/end time,
        to apply the feature, prevent fraud, and support customer help requests.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        We do not receive your full payment card number and do not store your card details.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4) How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>App Functionality</strong> — create accounts, show listings, show creator profiles, display uploads, enable favorites and reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Product Personalization</strong> — tailor Recommended results based on favorites, tags, and creator interest signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics</strong> — understand basic usage (like which features are used) to improve the app and fix bugs.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Support</strong> — respond to messages, troubleshoot issues, and help with account problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety and Abuse Prevention</strong> — detect spam, repeated abuse, malicious listings, and policy violations.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal and Compliance</strong> — follow laws, respond to valid legal requests, and enforce our terms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5) App Store “App Privacy” Categories (How We Label Data)</h2>
      <p>
        In the App Store, we may describe certain data as <strong>“Data Not Linked to You”</strong>.
        That means it may be collected but is not tied to your personal identity in our app privacy labels.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos or Videos</strong> — used for app functionality (to show listing logos/thumbnails) and analytics (basic performance).</li>
        <li><strong>Email Address</strong> — used for app functionality (login, verification, and account messages).</li>
        <li><strong>Other User Contact Info</strong> — used for product personalization and other purposes (creator profile contact options).</li>
        <li><strong>Other User Content</strong> — used for app functionality and analytics (listings, tags, reports).</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Support</strong> — used for app functionality and personalization (helping solve your issues faster).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Note: how data is labeled in App Store privacy nutrition labels can evolve as features change.
        This policy is intended to stay clear and consistent with those disclosures.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6) Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We may share information only in these situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With your choice</strong> — for example, if you share a listing or publish contact info on your profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Service providers</strong> — companies that help us run the Service (hosting, storage, basic monitoring). They must protect data.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety and legal reasons</strong> — to respond to valid legal requests or protect users, the public, and our rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Business changes</strong> — if the Service is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, data may transfer as part of that deal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7) Third-Party Links and Content</h2>
      <p>
        GameLinkr includes links to third-party gaming websites submitted by creators.
        When you open a website, you are leaving our Service and going to a third party.
        We are not responsible for third-party content, privacy practices, or data collection.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Tip: Always check the privacy policy of any website you visit, especially before entering personal info or downloading files.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>8) Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep information only as long as needed for the purposes described in this policy, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keeping your account active and letting you use features like favorites and submissions.</li>
        <li>Operating and improving listings, search, ranking, and safety systems.</li>
        <li>Handling support issues and enforcing our rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Retention times can vary. Some data may be kept longer if required for legal reasons, safety, or resolving disputes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>9) Your Choices and Controls</h2>
      <h3>A) Profile and Content</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can edit some profile details inside the app.</li>
        <li>You can choose what you upload and what you share publicly.</li>
        <li>You can remove favorites any time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B) Reports</h3>
      <p>
        If you report a listing, we store the report content so we can review it and take action.
        Misuse of the report system (spam or false reports) may result in limits or enforcement.
      </p>

      <h3>C) Account and Deletion Requests</h3>
      <p>
        You may request deletion of content (like a listing) using the in-app tools, and you can contact support for help.
        If you request account deletion, we may need to confirm ownership for safety before removing data.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Some information may remain in backups or logs for a limited time and be removed later as systems rotate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>10) Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information.
        No system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access controls to limit who can access internal tools.</li>
        <li>Basic monitoring for abuse and suspicious activity.</li>
        <li>Encrypted connections where supported by the platform and network.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>11) Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        GameLinkr is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child provided personal information through the Service,
        contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>12) International Users</h2>
      <p>
        If you use the Service from outside your region, your information may be processed in jurisdictions with different data protection laws.
        We take steps to protect information as described in this policy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>13) Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date above.
