      <p class="muted">
        This summary is provided for convenience only. The legally binding terms are the full sections below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Promotion is a paid feature</strong> that marks a creator’s listing as <strong>“Sponsored”</strong> and provides a moderate ranking boost.</li>
        <li><strong>Promotion duration</strong> is time-limited (e.g., 18 hours per purchase) and may be extended by purchasing again.</li>
        <li><strong>No guarantee</strong> of specific traffic, placement, impressions, clicks, or revenue. Results vary based on user interest and platform behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Content rules apply</strong>: promoted content must follow our policies and applicable law.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds</strong> are handled by Apple’s in-app purchase policies (where applicable).</li>

        <strong>Apple Notice:</strong> Purchases are processed by Apple using In-App Purchase. We do not collect your payment card details.
        Your purchase, cancellation, refund eligibility, and billing are governed by Apple’s terms and the App Store rules.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2) Acceptance of This Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        By purchasing Promotion or using any Sponsored feature in GameLinkr, you agree to this EULA & Terms.
        If you do not agree, do not purchase or use Promotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        You represent that you are legally able to enter into this agreement. If you are not, your parent/guardian must approve your purchase and use.
      </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3) Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“Promotion”</strong> means the paid feature that flags a listing as Sponsored and may provide a ranking boost.</li>
        <li><strong>“Sponsored”</strong> means a visible label/badge shown in the app indicating the listing is promoted.</li>
        <li><strong>“Listing”</strong> means a gaming website entry submitted by a creator to GameLinkr.</li>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4) Promotion Purchase Terms</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Product & Duration</h3>
      <p>
        Promotion is sold as a time-limited access to Sponsored status for a listing.
        The current offering may be described in-app (for example, <code>18 hours</code> per purchase).
        The exact duration begins when our service records the promotion as active and ends when the promotion period expires.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Extending an Active Promotion</h3>
      <p>
        If a listing is already Sponsored and you purchase Promotion again, the promotion end time may be extended by the purchased duration.
        Extensions are applied to the remaining time so that active promotions do not lose time.
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 No Subscription; May Change</h3>
      <p>
        Unless explicitly stated in-app, Promotion is a one-time purchase for a set time period and is not a subscription.
        We may change the available durations, pricing, and product identifiers in future releases in accordance with App Store policies.
      </p>

      <h3>4.4 Taxes</h3>
      <p>
        Taxes may apply depending on your jurisdiction and Apple’s policies. Apple typically determines and collects applicable taxes for in-app purchases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5) Ranking, Delivery, and Disclaimers</h2>

      <h3>5.1 Sponsored Badge and Boost</h3>
      <p>
        Sponsored listings display a “Sponsored” badge and may receive a moderate ranking boost in certain surfaces (e.g., Recommended).
        The boost is designed not to override personalization signals entirely.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 No Guarantees</h3>
      <p>
        We do not guarantee any specific results, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>minimum impressions, views, clicks, opens, favorites, conversions, or revenue,</li>
        <li>specific placement, ranking position, or time on screen,</li>
        <li>exclusive visibility, or</li>
        <li>continuous availability without interruption.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Factors affecting delivery include user preferences, device settings, region, network conditions, platform updates, moderation actions,
        and changes to ranking logic.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3 Availability</h3>
      <p>
        Promotion features may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, outages, or changes required by Apple or third parties.
        We may modify or discontinue Promotion at any time, but if we discontinue a purchased feature entirely we will handle users fairly and
        consistent with applicable law and App Store rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6) Content Standards for Promoted Listings</h2>
      <p>
        Promoted listings must comply with all applicable law and must not contain or link to prohibited content, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>illegal content or services,</li>
        <li>fraud, scams, phishing, or deceptive practices,</li>
        <li>malware, unwanted software, or harmful downloads,</li>
        <li>hate, harassment, or threats,</li>
        <li>sexual content involving minors or exploitation of any kind,</li>
        <li>content that infringes intellectual property rights,</li>
        <li>content that violates third-party terms (e.g., platform rules) or privacy laws,</li>
        <li>links intended to bypass network rules, school filters, or other restrictions where prohibited.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.1 Truthfulness and Accuracy</h3>
      <p>
        You must ensure your listing information is accurate and not misleading. This includes title, description, tags, images, and destination URLs.
        Do not use deceptive thumbnails, misleading claims, or impersonation.
      </p>

      <h3>6.2 We May Remove or Limit Promotions</h3>
      <p>
        We may remove Sponsored status, demote, or disable a promoted listing if it violates policies, poses user risk, or is subject to reports,
        legal complaints, or platform enforcement. We may do this with or without notice where necessary for safety or compliance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7) Refunds, Cancellations, and Chargebacks</h2>

      <h3>7.1 Apple Purchases</h3>
      <p>
        In-app purchases are processed by Apple. Refund requests are handled through Apple’s refund process and policies.
        We cannot directly issue Apple refunds for App Store purchases.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2 When We May Help</h3>
      <p>
        If you believe your Sponsored status did not apply properly due to a technical error on our side, contact us at
        <a href="mailto:gomegaassist@gmail.com">gomegaassist@gmail.com</a>. We may assist by investigating logs and restoring the feature where possible,
        consistent with App Store rules.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 Chargebacks</h3>
      <p>
        Initiating a chargeback may result in loss of access to paid features and may impact account standing. We reserve the right to limit or suspend
        accounts associated with abusive chargebacks or suspected fraud, consistent with law and platform rules.
      </p>
